# Pentest Probe - Web Vulnerability Scanner
Pentest Probe is a lightweight, customizable web vulnerability scanner designed to assess websites for common security issues. This tool helps security enthusiasts and developers identify weaknesses in their web applications, including SSL/TLS configurations and potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Broken Access Control.

# Features
SSL/TLS Scanning:

Analyze the SSL/TLS configuration of your website to identify weak ciphers, expired certificates, and other security misconfigurations.
Ensure compliance with industry standards by checking for vulnerabilities like POODLE, Heartbleed, and SSLv2/SSLv3.
SQL Injection Detection:

Test input fields and query parameters for SQL injection vulnerabilities, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands and gain unauthorized access to your database.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection:

Detect potential XSS vulnerabilities that could enable attackers to inject malicious scripts into your web pages, compromising user data and application integrity.
Broken Access Control:

Identify flaws in your access control mechanisms that could lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources or functionality, including Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).
